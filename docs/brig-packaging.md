# Brig resource layout and releases

`_folder/brig` is the standalone **mod directory** for the Steam Half-Life engine.
The release workflow builds both game DLLs from this repository for Windows x86;
the source asset directory intentionally contains no borrowed or stale game DLLs.
Half-Life must be installed and switched to `steam_legacy`. This does not provide
a separate engine, additional weapon/NPC code, RPG systems, or Sven game rules.

| Source | Destination / policy |
| --- | --- |
| `valve` | Protected HL base maps, models, sounds, sprites, events and UI; discard saves, caches, personal configs and engine/game binaries. Supply clean startup controls and Brig metadata. |
| `valve_russian` | HL Russian localization resources. |
| `valve_hd` | Optional `models/_Extra/valve_hd`, `sound/_Extra/valve_hd`, `sprites/_Extra/valve_hd`; never silently replace the base. |
| `svencoop` | Compatible models in `models/svencoop`, audio in `sound/svencoop`; add only missing compatible SPR files. Exclude Sven DLLs, scripts, events, configs, maps, HUD and UI definitions. |
| `svencoop_addon` | Overlay its models/audio onto the Sven namespace. Preserve **every original file**. Archive incompatible maps, GMR/GSR lists, configs and UI under `brig/_Extra/svencoop_addon`; conflicting sprites and adapted originals under `brig/_Extra/originals`. |
| `svencoop_event_*` | Separate namespaced model/audio variants, including nested Xmas variant folders; accompanying credits/UI images are inactive options. |
| `svencoop_downloads` | Downloaded map reports/metadata are excluded. |
| `cstrike`, `cstrike_hd` | Only `models` (strictly excluding `models/player`) and `sound`, under their own namespaces. No classes, cfg, maps, events, UI or game binaries. The supplied CS sound folder has only text metadata, no audio samples. |
| `Extras` | All originals preserved and sorted by resource type into `models/_Extra`, `sound/_Extra`, `sprites/_Extra`, `gfx/_Extra`, `resource/_Extra`, `docs/_Extra`. |

Resource namespaces prevent custom viewmodels, CS weapons, NPC skins and holiday
models from replacing the HL campaign assets. These are asset collections, and
must be selected by code/map resource references when developing the mod. Merely
installing a model never adds its original game's weapon/NPC mechanics.

Extra variants have stable directory IDs derived from their original parent path.
This keeps engine resource paths below `MAX_QPATH=64`, avoids name collisions and
keeps texture companion files beside their models. The manifest maps the short
paths back to the complete descriptive original names.

OGG (including files mislabeled `.wav`), stereo WAV and unsupported PCM formats are
adapted to mono PCM16 at 22050 Hz. Compatible WAVs are copied unchanged. Original
audio is preserved, and RIFF cue/loop markers are retained with resampled offsets.
Addon audio has priority over matching Sven audio. Base HL audio is protected.
Model sequence-group and sound-event fields are remapped in their existing
fixed-width binary fields when needed. SPR files are copied without conversion
or editing; incompatible/oversized files and conflicting addon sprites are kept
as inactive originals. A studio v9 file and models over legacy limits are also
archived rather than exposed as playable models.

`docs/brig-assets.json` is the audit: every output file, SHA-256, original source,
adaptation, excluded source/reason, and preservation checks for all addon/Extras
originals. `python tools/validate_brig.py` validates checksums, case collisions,
studio v10 headers/tables/limits and dependencies, SPR v2 frame data, WAV format,
BSP v30 lumps, HUD sprite references, clean startup metadata and source-matched
`network/delta.lst`. Unknown payload files fail validation. Dot-prefixed file
synchronization temporary copies are ignored and never packaged.

The migration script refuses to overwrite an existing Brig directory. To repeat
the migration, restore `_folder/need restock` from the `source_commit` in the audit
in a separate checkout, install ffmpeg, and run:

```sh
python tools/migrate_brig.py --remove-source
```

Only after the generated result passes validation is the original staging folder
deleted. Git history retains the input. Do not add that staging folder back to
new release commits.

## Binary compatibility

The copied SDK exposes anniversary-only tail callbacks despite a frozen API
version. Client initialization now copies only the legacy engine-table prefix;
the server does the same for its engine callbacks. Guard-page regression tests
put an unreadable page directly after the old table. HLTV stufftext is consumed
and ignored when the filtered client-command callback is absent. It is never
replaced by an unrestricted command call.

## CI and Releases

CI builds Linux SDK binaries with GCC/Clang, runs 32-bit guard-page tests, validates
the assets, builds the Windows x86 DLLs with v143, and makes a checked installable
Windows ZIP artifact. The release workflow publishes the Windows package only.

1. Merge the prepared branch into `master`.
2. Push a tag such as `v1.0.0`, or use **Actions → Release brig for steam_legacy →
   Run workflow**, select the desired branch/commit and enter a new `v*` tag.
3. The workflow compiles DLLs, validates resources, checks DLL architecture/exports,
   packages `brig/`, reads every ZIP member to verify CRC, and emits SHA-256.
4. It verifies that an existing tag resolves to the built commit, uploads the ZIP
   and checksum to a draft release, then publishes the complete release. A manual
   run creates a missing tag at the selected commit. Existing releases are never
   overwritten: use a new version. A failed publication can leave a draft release;
   remove that incomplete draft before retrying the same tag.

`GITHUB_TOKEN` needs `contents: write` only in the publish job. No personal token,
external packager or RAR installation is required. Repository Actions must be
enabled (GitHub disables inherited workflows in newly created forks).

## In-game acceptance check

CI cannot run a licensed graphical Steam Half-Life installation. Before marking a
version stable, test on a real `steam_legacy` install: menu startup, New Game
(`c0a0`), Hazard Course (`t0a0`), a local `crossfire` server, HUD/ammo/health,
weapon viewmodels, sound playback, save/load and reconnect. Resource checks and
successful compilation do not claim a completed engine playtest.
